Each 50-sweep sample was emptied into a 7.57l, sealable, plastic bag.

Diet was changed as necessary (i.e. when depleted, moldy, or dried out) and fresh vegetation was added every other day until death or pupation of the weevil larva or emergence of a parasitoid.  In 2009, five larvae were added to each rearing cup.  Due to relatively high mortality in that year, however, in 2010 larvae were reared individually. Low densities of weevil larvae in some fields resulted in low sample sizes for rearing, and as a consequence few insects were successfully reared from those sites. Thus, for estimates and analysis of site occupancy and proportion parasitism, I only included sites for which at least 20 larvae were successfully reared through to pupation or emergence of a parasitoid.  This resulted in the exclusion of 6 sites in 2009 and 7 sites in 2010. Alfalfa weevil larvae that died during the rearing process were not included in calculations of proportion parasitism.

saul01,2010-2012,france,anjou - loire valley,yes,"Cabbage root fly infestation was monitored on every site (with the same protocol as in LERA01 dataset) and may have played a role (indirectly on aphids and directly on yield).

Two other ""covariates"" were not measured quantitatively but may have played a role :

- Herbirore damages varied from one site to the other and were found locally important. Focal plants (broccoli) were often damaged by birds, rabbits and flea beetles. Weevils (Baris), bugs and whiteflies were observed more occasionnaly but  may have reached high densities on some of our study plots.

- Plant growth conditions (e.g. soil structure, pH, organic matter, drought, competition with the crop...) were site dependent  and clearly influence plant production (yield of focal plants).","In each site, fifteen successive  plants from the same row of the initial crop (brassica) were removed and replaced in March-April by 15 focal ones (broccoli cvs Marathon) planted in the ground. These plants aged of 10 weeks had received no chemical treatment and were insect-free. The first focal plant was placed 12 rows from the field entrance edge and was the 12th on this row.",NA,"Ten out of the fifteen focal plants were inspected every week. Aphids, aphid mummies, ladybird beetles (adults and larvae) and syrphids larvae were counted on  whole plants. Species were not distinguished. Carabids were monitored using two pitfall traps per field which were put in place in all the fields at the same time. Pitfalls were checked weekly during three consecutive weeks.

The mean density of L. hesperus (adults and nymphs combined) was calculated
from the day of the first recorded sample until 30 June or until the first pesticide application targeting L. hesperus was made if this occurred prior to 30 June. Because
that time interval was not the same for all the cotton fields, the mean density of L. hesperus was calculated as a weighted regression: the density of L. hesperus on the Yaxis was plotted against the sampled day on the X-axis, and the mean L. hesperus density was estimated as the area under the resulting curve, divided by the number of days covered by the sampling period.",NA,Yields were obtained directly from growers.

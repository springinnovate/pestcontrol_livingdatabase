can you write me a script to load a CSV as a table then for one field and a list of values that are in that field, can you pull out all the values in a set of the other fields listed that correspond to that original value?

input: 'query_value_list', 'field_name', 'output_field_list'

expect that there are multiple identical matches in field_name for any one element of query_value_list

I would like the output to be easily reformattable, like in a template but for now
